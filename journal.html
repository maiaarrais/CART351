      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>
        Today I worked on setting up the basic HTML and CSS for my class project page. 
        I applied my knowledge of how to style headers, lists, and links to create a clean, modern look. 
        Next, I want to focus on creating this journal page to track my progress. 
        I will also improve on the asthetics once I know more about the content I want to include.

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        This week, I made sure I had my python environment set up and refreshed what I previously learned about manipulating the DOM. 
        I also began brainstorming ideas for my final project and how to integrate various web technologies.
